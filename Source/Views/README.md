## 🔑 **Navigation Across Views**

Each **CourseSection** connects to multiple lessons through **SwiftUI NavigationLinks**.  
For example:

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: LessonDetailView(section: courseSections[0], showTabBar: $showTabBar)) {
    Text("Start Learning")
}
```
# The CourseSection organizes modules into different views with enhanced design, seamless transitions, and intuitive navigation.

## 📋 Views Breakdown and Features

1. CourseSection.swift

Organizes all course modules:

	•	Module-Based Navigation: Each course section contains multiple lessons.
	•	Interactive Learning Flow: Navigate easily between sections and their content.

```swift
struct CourseSection: Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var title: String
    var caption: String
    var color: Color
    var image: Image
    var lessonText: String
}
```

2. LessonsListView.swift

Displays all available lessons within a module:

	•	Beautiful UI with Gradient Backgrounds
	•	Dynamic Navigation using NavigationLink to lesson details.

```swift
LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color("Background 2"), Color.black.opacity(0.9)]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)

```
3. LessonDetailView.swift

Provides in-depth lesson details:

	•	Code Snippet Blocks Styled Like a Compiler:
 
 #include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

	•	Favorites Button to mark important lessons.

4. QuizView.swift

Offers interactive quizzes at the end of each section:

	•	Score Tracking and Feedback.
```swift
ForEach(quizzes) { question in
    Text(question.text)
}
```
5. FavoritesView.swift

Displays lessons marked as favorites by the user:

	•	Simple Navigation with easy access to saved lessons.

6. NotificationsView.swift

Manages notifications and alerts for new content:

	•	Real-Time Updates via Firebase.
	•	Displays messages like:
	•	“New Lesson Available”
	•	“Quiz Completed”

7. HelpView.swift

Provides community support via in-app messaging:

	•	Chat Interface connected to Firebase Firestore.
	•	Real-Time Updates for smooth communication.

📦 Technologies Used

	•	SwiftUI for UI design
	•	Firebase for authentication and real-time database
	•	Rive for animations
	•	GitHub for version control

🎨 Design Highlights

	1.	Gradient Backgrounds:
Each view utilizes custom gradients for enhanced aesthetics:

```swift
LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color("Background 2"), Color.black.opacity(0.9)]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
```
🎯 Future Improvements

	•	Add more lessons on advanced C++ topics.
	•	Implement progress tracking for each user.
	•	Add a notification system for lesson updates.
	•	Integrate user authentication for personalized experiences.
